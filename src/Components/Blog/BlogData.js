        I recently led an project "Intro to Computer Science and AI" workshop
        designed specifically for high school freshmen. This initiative aimed to
        engage students with the foundational concepts of programming while
        introducing them to the fascinating world of artificial intelligence.
        <br />
        This pilot program was implemented in selected ninth-grade robotics,
        math, and science classrooms within the TRIO Educational Talent Search's
        target area schools, supported by the US Department of Education.
        <br />
        The workshop took place at Wossman High School and Neville High School,
        where we introduced students to core programming principles, and learned
        about AI applications through interactive activities and hands-on
        projects.
        <br />
        Students had the opportunity to explore coding concepts, work
        collaboratively on problem-solving tasks, and experience the excitement
        of building their own projects.
        <br />
        Feedback from the students and teachers was overwhelmingly positive,
        highlighting the fun and interactive nature of the sessions.
        <br />
        We're thrilled to announce that this is just the beginning! Plans are in
        place to pilot additional workshops in more high schools across the
        Monroe area that fall under the TRIO Program.
        <br />
        Stay tuned for updates as we continue to expand our outreach and foster
        a love for computer science among the next generation!

        At the recent College Symposium, "Everyone Has a Story," held at ULM on
        October 3rd, 2023, I had the honor of being a key speaker, presenting
        for an hour during the session titled "Blazing Trails to Success in Web
        Development and Mobile Development." It was a privilege to share my
        journey, connect with others, and learn from their experiences. The
        opportunity to discuss my path in web development, project management,
        and leadership was incredibly rewarding. During my talk, I focused on
        how to break into web development and the essential project management
        skills required to excel in the field. I covered a range of tools that
        are valuable for both web development and managing projects efficiently.
        I also walked the audience through the complete workflow, starting from
        the initial discovery call with clients to the final handover of the
        project. As someone who has led several projects, I shared insights on
        leadership, team management, and strategies for effectively
        collaborating with clients. It was a fulfilling experience to exchange
        ideas and inspire future professionals in the field.
