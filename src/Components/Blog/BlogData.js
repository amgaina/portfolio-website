  //       I recently led an project "Intro to Computer Science and AI" workshop
  //       designed specifically for high school freshmen. This initiative aimed to
  //       engage students with the foundational concepts of programming while
  //       introducing them to the fascinating world of artificial intelligence.
  //       <br />
  //       This pilot program was implemented in selected ninth-grade robotics,
  //       math, and science classrooms within the TRIO Educational Talent Search's
  //       target area schools, supported by the US Department of Education.
  //       <br />
  //       The workshop took place at Wossman High School and Neville High School,
  //       where we introduced students to core programming principles, and learned
  //       about AI applications through interactive activities and hands-on
  //       projects.
  //       <br />
  //       Students had the opportunity to explore coding concepts, work
  //       collaboratively on problem-solving tasks, and experience the excitement
  //       of building their own projects.
  //       <br />
  //       Feedback from the students and teachers was overwhelmingly positive,
  //       highlighting the fun and interactive nature of the sessions.
  //       <br />
  //       We're thrilled to announce that this is just the beginning! Plans are in
  //       place to pilot additional workshops in more high schools across the
  //       Monroe area that fall under the TRIO Program.
  //       <br />
  //       Stay tuned for updates as we continue to expand our outreach and foster
  //       a love for computer science among the next generation!

        At the recent College Symposium, "Everyone Has a Story," held at ULM on
        October 3rd, 2023, I had the honor of being a key speaker, presenting
        for an hour during the session titled "Blazing Trails to Success in Web
        Development and Mobile Development." It was a privilege to share my
        journey, connect with others, and learn from their experiences. The
        opportunity to discuss my path in web development, project management,
        and leadership was incredibly rewarding. During my talk, I focused on
        how to break into web development and the essential project management
        skills required to excel in the field. I covered a range of tools that
        are valuable for both web development and managing projects efficiently.
        I also walked the audience through the complete workflow, starting from
        the initial discovery call with clients to the final handover of the
        project. As someone who has led several projects, I shared insights on
        leadership, team management, and strategies for effectively
        collaborating with clients. It was a fulfilling experience to exchange
        ideas and inspire future professionals in the field.

        On October 20th, 2024, I attended the Biomedical Research and Industry
        Day at ULM, an enlightening experience where I learned from
        distinguished guest speakers, including Dr. Khalid A. El Sayed, Dr.
        Aaron R. Navratil, Dr. Corie Robinson, Dr. Emily Stevenson, and Dr.
        Anitaben Tailor. Their discussions covered groundbreaking advancements
        in biomedical and medical research, highlighting how emerging
        technologies are shaping the future of healthcare and offering insights
        into career development as a domain expert. I had the opportunity to
        present a poster titled "Analyzing Key Factors and Trends in Cancer
        Disparities Among African Americans in Louisiana." In collaboration with
        Dr. Sreekumari, our research analyzed cancer data from 2016-2020
        provided by state cancer profiles, underscoring the critical need to
        understand the underlying causes of rising cancer cases. We utilized
        Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas for data analysis
        and visualization, along with statistical analysis software to conduct
        correlation analysis on various risk factors and mortality rates. The
        event was an invaluable experience, not only for deepening my
        understanding of cancer disparities but also for expanding my knowledge
        on how to boost oneâ€™s career by becoming a domain expert. Interacting
        with professionals in the field and exchanging ideas was both inspiring
        and rewarding, reaffirming my commitment to impactful research and
        continuous learning in the biomedical arena.
